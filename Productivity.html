</h6>                              
      <p>Something that has always attracted me towards a person is the discipline and productive habits
toward life and goals. There are so many entrepreneurs and successful business people we keep
seeing in our life. And no doubt we all get influenced by their journey of achievements as well. And
the next thing that comes to our mind is being like them. Isn’t it?
No doubt we all get 24 hours a day but still, some of us always keep complaining about having not
enough time. But productive people make the best use of the same amount of time and live a
content life.<br></p>
<p>
What do you think what's so unique about them? Any superpowers? Of course not.
The only difference is that productive people start their day in an organized way. They have a clear
mindset to run their day according to their schedule.
One must be productive Instead of being busy all the time. Being productive is all about getting
things done consistently and with a disciplined mindset. You should not focus on having perfection
in your work, all you should do is to just start something you want to work for. Don’t wait for
perfection just start and you will be ahead each day then your yesterday.
In our daily life where we often get distracted during our working hours, be it small or big ones,
productive people keep better control over their habits. They accomplish more than others and are
more successful in their business as well.<br>
If you are looking forward to being productive in your life then start taking small steps as you cannot
become the one overnight. Even research has proved that productivity gives better results.
So, let's learn about the habits that can help you to live a productive life. Here are they: - <br>
      <h5>1. Take Actions</h5>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
         It's good to make plans but it's better to take action to achieve your goals. People who take action
are supposed to be more ahead than people who just engaged in making plans without
implementing them.
      <br>

      </p>
      <h5>2.Avoid Multitasking</h5>
<p>So many of us consider multi-tasking will save our time. And we put ourselves completely into doing
so many things altogether but end up being exhausted and all drained. Do you think it’s helpful? Not
at all. Because the fact is that multitasking doesn’t save our time but significantly slows us down. It
affects our mental state and it makes our performances very bad and low
</p>

<h5>3. Follow the 20/10 Rule</h5>
<p>The best way to have an organized day is to follow this 20 /10 rule. You must be wondering what it's
all about. But it’s the best strategy to finish your work without getting stressed or tired. If you are
going to work for 30 minutes then divide your time in 20/10. It means work for 20 minutes and then 
take a break for the next 10 minutes. It's that simple. Having a break during working hours boosts
your mood and increase your productivity level. </p>
<h5>4. Make a To-Do List in the Morning</h5>
<p>How many of you have ever tried this? Those who make their to-do list in the morning are more able
to have a well-organized day. They work according to their schedule and at the end of the day feel
more relaxed and calmer. Having a to list helps you remember things you have to complete and you
spend a stress-free day</p>
<h5>5. Get up Early</h5>
<p>No doubt you all must have heard this thing all your life and would have underestimated this habit
too. Like how does it matter, Right? But do you know all the successful people also wake up early
and believe in having a morning routine? Because our mind is more productive in the morning time.
And if you get up early before the rest of the world, you will have more alone time to prepare for the
day. Apart from this highly productive people complete their most difficult task early in the morning
to run a productive day so that they can work on other tasks properly.</p><br>
<h6>'Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of
the day.' - Mark Twai</h6><br>
<h5>6. Keep Your Work Desk Neat and Organized</h5>
<p>The more cluttering desk you will have the more cluttered mindset you will have. Having a tidy work
desk is as important as having a glass of filtered water for your body. Make sure you clean your desk
every day so you can work more constructively.</p>
<h5>7. Divide Your Goals into Small Steps</h5>
<p>The easiest way to complete your tasks is, just to divide them into small steps. Isn’t it useful? When
we decide to achieve the goal, we tend to accomplish them in one go, and that gives us lots of stress
and sometimes we end up leaving it in between. And that completely demotivate us. But if we divide
them into small steps, it gets easier for us to have our work done properly. Because we can’t
accomplish a big goal in one go. And so often we get drained and start losing interest too. But if you
will work on small steps you will be able to finish it more creatively.</p>
<h5>8. Happy People are More Productive</h5>
<p>
Happiness increase more productivity. Happy people keep a positive outlook and that helps them to
balance not only their personal life but also their professional life. They are more productive and
they not only inspire themselves to do more but each person around them. Being productive makes
your life peaceful and better and who doesn’t want a better life?<br>
