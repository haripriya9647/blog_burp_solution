             <h5>Bitcoin</h5>                                     
      <p> Bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to be created and remains the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market cap. Bitcoin is a global peer-to-peer electronic payment system that allows parties to transact directly with each other without the need for an intermediary such as a bank. It is used to buy merchandise anonymously. In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value. The Bitcoin whitepaper, which outlined how this revolutionary new currency would work, was released in 2008, and the Bitcoin network launched in 2009. Since its launch Bitcoin has experienced no downtime, allowing anyone to transfer value at any time and from anywhere.<br>
The value of a Bitcoin is wholly dependent on what investors are willing to pay for it at a point in time. As well, if a Bitcoin exchange folds up, clients with Bitcoin balances have no recourse to get them back.
      </p> <br>
      <h5>How did this work? (Bitcoin Mining)</h5>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
         Bitcoin mining is the process by which bitcoins are released into circulation. Generally, mining requires the solving of computationally difficult puzzles in order to discover a new block, which is added to the blockchain. The independent individuals and companies who own the governing computing power and participate in the Bitcoin network, also known as “miners,” are motivated by rewards (the release of new bitcoin) and transaction fees paid in bitcoin. These miners can be thought of as the decentralized authority enforcing the credibility of the Bitcoin network. New bitcoin is being released to the miners at a fixed, but periodically declining rate, such that the total supply of bitcoins approaches 21 million. Currently, there are roughly 3 million bitcoins that have yet to be mined.
      <br>

      </p>
      <h5>Cryptocurrency</h5>
<p>Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Cryptocurrencies can be sent directly between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional financial institutions. The most important feature of a cryptocurrency is that it is not controlled by any central authority: the decentralized nature of the blockchain makes cryptocurrencies theoretically immune to the old ways of government control and interference.<br>

There are now more than 3000 cryptocurrencies in existence, with each falling into one of the three major categories: altcoins, tokens, and Bitcoin.<br>
To understand the revolutionary impact of cryptocurrencies, you need to consider both properties. Bitcoin as a permissionless, irreversible, and pseudonymous means of payment is an attack on the control of banks and governments over the monetary transactions of their citizens. You can‘t hinder someone to use Bitcoin, you can‘t prohibit someone to accept a payment, you can‘t undo a transaction.<br></p>

<h5>Cryptography</h5>
<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that is created and managed through the use of advanced encryption techniques known as cryptography. There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files.<br>
Cryptography can be strong or weak, as explained above. Cryptographic strength is measured in the time and resources it would require to recover the plaintext. The result of strong cryptography is ciphertext that is very difficult to decipher without possession of the appropriate decoding tool. How difficult? Given all of today’s computing power and available time — even a billion computers doing a billion checks a second — it is not possible to decipher the result of strong cryptography before the end of the universe.<br>
<h6><i>Types of Cryptography</i></h6>

<p>Symmetric Key Cryptography also known as Secret Key Cryptography or Conventional Cryptography, Symmetric Key Cryptography is an encryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message share a single, common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. The Algorithm use is also known as a secret key algorithm or sometimes called symmetric algorithm A key is a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm or cipher.<br>
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as Public-key cryptography, refers to a cryptographic algorithm which requires two separate keys, one of which is private and one of which is public. The public key is used to encrypt the message and the private one is used to decrypt the message.</p>
