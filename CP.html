             <h5>What is Coding?</h5>                                     
      <p> Coding simple means writing codes. Coding involves writing many lines of codes to create a software program. Coding is also programming but it’s used to implement the initial steps of computer programming. The term programming is used in a much broader sense, unlike coding which involves writing codes in various languages as instructed. Computers don’t communicate in our language; it only understands the machine code, which is the binary language.<br>
A coder produces codes at a production level which means they have a thorough understanding of the ABC of the language they are writing in. Writing code is just one part of developing software. This is where programming comes to the picture.
      </p> <br>
      <h5>What is Programming?</h5>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
         Programming is the above in addition to the design work. It’s trying to come up with a good solution, or clean code, or something re-usable. Programming means to program a machine or application to run without any errors. Programming is the common term used to describe the process of feeding machine with a set of instructions to perform.<br>
It is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm, there can be no program.<br>
At a minimum, algorithms require constructs that perform sequential processing, selection for decision-making, and iteration for repetitive control. As long as the language provides these basic statements, it can be used for algorithm representation.

      <h5>Coders Vs Programmers</h5>
<p>Coders vs Programmers
Programmers often write technical specifications documents containing requirements that the final product should meet and problems that it should solve. Coders then follow those specifications to write code but do not work on specifications themselves. Programmers are also involved in compiling, debugging, testing, and implementation of the code. In other words, the duties of a programmer can go far beyond coding.<br>
Simply, I would say a Coder is someone who turns logic into a language machine will understand whereas a Programmer deals with much more than just writing codes which is an overhead level for some coders. Coders are programmers but with less expertise.</p>
      <!--img src="img/12.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
<h6>It is easier to become a Coder than a Programmer</h6>
<p>For Example, If we take a TV remote and press the volume button to raise the volume, the volume will increase but there are logic and programming behind the whole process which are developed by programmers. But for Coders, it is tough to create that complete program that performs different tasks.<br>
To be a coder, one should know the syntax, but to be a programmer, one should understand data structures and algorithms as well as be able to create such algorithms.<br>
Firstly Master a singular programming language. Initially, you practice code in that language you will be called a Coder but as soon as you develop a program that performs any assignment or task then you are called a programmer. It also depends on your project what you develop how big and how value does it.
