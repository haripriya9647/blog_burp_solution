      <p>People try to run away from spirituality considering that it is only about God, and lectures and so on. It is being misconstrued by many of us today. There are so called flag bearers of spirituality and misinterpreted in such a way that people are at times hesitant to call themselves as spiritual. However, the truth is far from what has been passed over to us. </p>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>Let us see what are those 5 things that you must know if you want to embrace spirituality in life:<p>
      <h5>1. Spirituality & Religion are different- </h5>
<p>People often have a misconception that being spiritual is being religious. However, that’s not the case. Both the terms are different yet significant in their own way. Spirituality is all about body, mind and soul. While Religion on the other hand, is something that imbibes values in an individual. Understanding both the concepts to its roots is of significance.
</p> 
<h5>2. Spirituality is not only about God- 
</h5>
<p>
 Spirituality is when you find your true self. Many times we associate spirituality only with God. But that’s just half of what reality is. Yes, it connects us with the divine power but it also makes us realise that the divine power lies within us. 
Spirituality is just a medium for you to discover your true self through different ways and means.
 
</p>
      
<h5>3. Spirituality and Science are two sides of the same coin:
</h5>
<p>Science and Spirituality are both integral parts of each other. Science without spirituality is just a logic without connection. The creation of this entire Universe is itself a mystery yet.  
The Mighty Scientist Albert Einstein says, “I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon. I want to know his thoughts, the rest are details.”

</p>
<h5>4. It is about Faith and not Superstition:
</h5>
<p>Often we believe that spirituality means we are going to fall in the trap of superstition. Now, superstition can be a trap but not Faith. In fact, Faith is the base of a spiritual person. If you are superstitious, you cannot be a spiritual person. There is a very thick line between both of them. 
 </p>
<h5>5. It is a healing institution: 
</h5>

 <p>
Lastly, it is a healing institution. Many studies have proven that people going through mental health have rooted for spirituality. By way of holistic healing, they calm themselves by way of meditation, various therapies or techniques which are part of spirituality. 
 <br>
Spirituality is one of the most beautiful things that can happen to anyone. So, when next time anyone calls you a spiritual person, remember that healing and remaining peaceful is your priority, and with spirituality if you are able to achieve the balance that you are required to, then go for it!
