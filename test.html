      <p> Wikipedia says Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on the cloud.
In Simple words, Cloud Storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet. It allows you to save data and files in a location that you access through the internet or a dedicated private network connection.
Data that you save on the cloud storage becomes the responsibility of a third-party cloud provider. These third-party provider hosts, secures, manages, and maintains the servers and linked infrastructure and ensures that you have access to the data whenever you need it.
      </p> <br>
      <h5>How does Cloud Storage Work?</h5>
      <img src="img/14.jpg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; >

      <p><br>
          Cloud Storages is purchased from a third-party cloud vendor who owns and runs data storage capacity and provides it across the internet.
Cloud storage uses servers to store data however, the data is sent to servers at an off-site location. Most of the servers you use are virtual machines hosted on a physical server. As your storage needs increase, the provider creates new virtual servers to meet demand.
      <br>

      <h5>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Storage.</h5>
      <p>In the world of data, data, and a lot of data, Most of us have limited physical storage. The only data storage option has left with us is Cloud Storage. Some of its advantages are-</p>

<h6>1. Third-Party Management:</h6><p> Your data is stored in the cloud and it is the responsibility of the vendor or the provider to protect the data from theft and damage. Most of us have a lot of data that has to be stored securely and safely such that there is no chance of data damage. So when we store it on the cloud it is the responsibility of the provider to keep it protected. <br>
<h6>2. Security:</h6><p> As cloud storage becomes more common, data security is an increasing concern. , as nothing on the internet is completely secure. So, Data stored in the cloud is nearly always stored in an encrypted form that would need to be cracked before an invader could read the information. <br>
<h6>3. Cost Efficient:</h6><p>Using online data storage, the company reduces the expenses of internal resources. With this technology, the company itself does not require any internal power and support to manage and store their data, the cloud storage vendor manages it all. In today’s world, many cloud storage service provides free cloud storages for small business and users.</p>
     <br>
      
<h6>4. Scalability and Mobility:</h6>

<p>Cloud storage is scalable and flexible. Capacity is virtually unlimited. If the current plan of storage is not enough, you can upgrade the service plan. It can be used conveniently to access information to sales staff who travel, freelance employees, or remote employees, for better work-life balance. It offers businesses more flexibility overall versus hosting on a local server. Employees who are working on the premises or at remote locations can easily access all the could services. All they need is Internet connectivity.<br>

<h6>5. Back-up and Restore Data:</h6>
<p>Once the data is stored in a Cloud, it is easier to get the back-up and recovery of that, which is otherwise a very time taking process on-premise.</p><br>
<h6>6. Multiple Users and Synchronization: </h6>
<p>The storage can be set up once and the data can be stored and shared among multiple users at a time using the same storage. Almost every storage vendor gives the sync feature. With synchronization, you can sync the cloud storage data with any device you want. There is no need to copy data from one device to another, the only thing that is required is a good internet connection to have access to all the files.<br>
<b>Well, everything comes with two sides: good and bad. Here are some of the limitations of cloud storage.<br></p></b>

<h6>1. Data Privacy</h6>
<p>While working with cloud computing services is a security risk. Before choosing cloud technology, one should be well aware that you will be sharing all your sensitive information with a third-party cloud computing service provider. Hackers might access this information. </p><br>
<h6>2. Technical Issues</h6>
<p>Cloud technology is always apt to an outage and other technical issues. Even the best cloud service provider companies may face this type of trouble.</p><br>
<h6>3. Internet Dependency</h6>
<p>It should be considered while working with cloud computing. That’s because your cloud provider may face power loss, low internet connectivity, service maintenance, etc.</p> <br>

<h4><i>Conclusion</i></h4>
<p>The conclusion of the above story is one can use cloud storage as it offers a great advantage to customers of all sizes, simple users, developers, enterprises, all types of organizations, etc. Every big tech company has its cloud service. No matter whether it’s a small or big business, everyone requires cloud service to store its data.
We can’t deny the fact that In the last decade, cloud services have gained so much popularity in the software industry and it is the fastest-growing part of network-based computing. Hence It is not possible to add all the factors and elements in just one story as the benefits of cloud storage over local disk are many, the drawbacks are few and can be easily managed.</p>
