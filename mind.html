      <p>Our ability to make decisions and to react in a certain way all depends on our mindset.
So how do you define mindset?
A mindset is a set of assumptions, habits, or routines held by one or more human beings.
In our every days life we come across so many people, with a different mindset. And obviously,
you will meet no one who will have the same perception to see or feel things in the same way.
Undoubtedly it’s all because of our different way of thinking. The same thing will have different
meanings for two other people.<br>
Did you ever think about who has set this mindset or from where these different perceptions
comes to our mind?<br>
It’s your mindset that makes you win in some situation or to lose, it’s your mindset to see
something as a failure or to see something as a lesson. It’s all about how do you think. And the
fact is that one can not change other mindsets it’s you who can decide. It completely depends on
you.<br></p>
      <h5>Types of Mindset</h5>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
         There are two types of mindset one is the growth mindset and the other is the fixed mindset.
The kind of mindset you have shows your character and your real worth as a human being.
      <br></p>
<h5>1. Growth Mindset
</h5>
<p>
  People with a growth mindset learn from their mistakes and have confidence in their capabilities.
They accept failures and take them as a lesson, and appreciate little things in their life with a
grateful heart. They believe in understating things or people rather than judging them. They are
optimistic people and believe in motivating others. Their mindset helps them to be more
productive in their life and career. They believe in learning new things and take appropriate
action for them.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Fixed Mindset</h5>
<p>On the other hand people with a fixed mindset give up so easily, they keep blaming their fortune
for every single thing that happens in their life. They compare their growth with others and make
themselves feel less every time. They don’t believe in their potential and find excuses to face any
tough situation in their life. Their beliefs are limited and that stops them to achieve good results.
They avoid taking risks and demotivate others as well. They don’t healthily take criticism, instead,
they make a boundary for themselves.
</p>

<h4><i>Mindset is Everything</i></h4>
<p>
Mindset is the most important thing in our life. If a growth mindset can make you then a fixed
mindset can break you as well. Learn to see a glass half full rather than complaining about having
a glass half empty. Have a mindset to accept things positively and you will open limitless
opportunities for your life. You can never have good outcomes with a negative mindset. Be it
emotionally, spiritually, or physically whatever you will feed your mind, will be your destiny. Make
sure you choose wisely because the cost of it is your own life. Make it worthy.
