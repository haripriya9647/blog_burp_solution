      <p>None of us in our entire life would have ever thought that a time will come when the
whole world will be controlled by a virus. The roads will be empty without a single
human being. The markets and all the educational institutes won't be able to open for
the students.<br>
Who would have thought that social distancing and covering your mouth with a
mask would be an important part of our life?<br>
Have you ever thought about that in your dreams?<br>
Of course not. Not any of us. But yet this Is the biggest truth we have to encounter
this year, a bitter one indeed.
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
        This pandemic has hit all of us very hard in different ways. Some lost their loved
ones and some lost their jobs or home. Many people walked the long roads on their
own feet to reach their homes. We all have seen helpless situations during this
difficult time. Fear has ruled all of us in different shapes.
</p>
<p>
      
But as they say, adversities often bring opportunities too in disguise. And absolutely
this hard time showed us a completely different picture. This pandemic showed us a
giant mirror to analyze where are we going wrong or what is something that should
not be taken granted for. The life we were living before was not as difficult as it has
become now.
But despite all of this many positive factors still existed there.
There are so many key takeaways we can take from this pandemic. Let's reflect on
those points:-
      </p>
      <h5>1. Humans are Fragile Before Nature</h5>
<p>This pandemic has been the best teacher to show us how helpless and fragile we
humans are before nature. No amount of money or power can save us when nature
is against us. After having so much technology in the world we humans consider we
have solutions for every single problem. But when it comes to nature we are still so
far to deal with natural disasters.
</p>

<h5>2. One can Learn from Anywhere</h5>
<p>There was a time when one was bound to go out of their house to learn the skills or
to get the education they need and no doubt it was necessary too. And still, it has
more value but with the help of digital media, it became easier for the people to
continue their studies or learning course, just by sitting in their houses. This whole
year has been an example of how learning knows no limits. Just have a will to learn. </p>
<h5>3. Kindness is the Precious Treasure</h5>
<p>One of the precious treasure that helped the world in this pandemic was kindness.
When the people were losing their lives, their jobs, and home for having no money,
so many kind people and communities came together to serve the needy ones. On
one side where the people are losing the sense of humanity and being selfish, this
pandemic taught us that we humans are nothing when we are alone. It’s the unity of
us that makes our life easy on earth when the time is hard. Be kind it's never out of
the trend.</p>
<h5>4. The Cost of Living is Priceless</h5>
<p>If you think you are strong enough to deal with this virus then you should take note
of it very seriously. Because this virus is the same for everyone whether you are rich
or poor. It spares no one. We may buy everything on this earth but we can't buy a
life as it is beyond our control. Take care of yourself so that your loved ones can be
taken care of by you.</p><br>

<h5>5. Life is Uncertain</h5>
<p>Going through a rough year we all must have felt this fear in our mind that life can
change in the blink of our eye. There is no guaranteed tomorrow for any of us. This
virus came all of a sudden and changed our total perception of life. It is still not in
control. Of course, so many scientists and doctors are working hard to make the
vaccine to get rid of this disease, but still, no one is sure for how long we have to live
this life with a mask on our mouth and the fear on our mind. Precaution is the only
cure for now.</p>
<h5>6. Reflect on the Lessons You have Learned</h5>
<p>TSo why don’t we live the life we should live today instead of living in our past and
worrying about the future? Why don’t we humans learn to be more kind and humble
to each other, knowing that we need each other to survive on this planet?
This year will always be remembered by each of us as it handed us lots of suffering
and unavoidable situations but yes so many opportunities as well to appreciate all
the things we have taken for granted for all our life. The quality time with our loved

ones, exploring new skills, and giving time to our lost hobbies. Of course, there were
moments of pain and tears but there were moments of happiness and gratefulness
too.</p>
<p>
As this year has just finished don’t forget to reflect on how you survived in this tough
time. Pick the best out of the worst. So that you can carry the good memories to your
new year and not the bitterness of the hard time.<br>
Choose wisely. There is so much love and positivity all around. Just open your eyes
with a different perspective. You will have more to be grateful.</p>
