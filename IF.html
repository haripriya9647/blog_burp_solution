      <p>In the word Intermittent Fasting intermittent means periodic and fasting means one is not eating anything which consists of calories (carbs, protein, and fat).

There are many different ways of doing intermittent fasting but the 16:8 attitude of eating which people sometimes call the 16:8 diet or 16:8 plan is a very popular type of fasting.
<br>
This involves fasting every day for 14–16 hours and limiting your daily eating cycle to 8–10 hours. Within this cycle of eating, you can fit in two, three, or more meals. This method of fasting can be as simple as not having anything after dinner and skipping breakfast.</p>
      <h5>My Eating Routine</h5>
      <!--img src="img/13.jpeg" class="left" style="width:300px;height:200px"; ><br-->
      <p>
         I have been practicing it for more than 12weeks. And it had changed my life in better ways. When I was practicing this fast, I had to practice the same routine of eating(16:8) into 3–4 meals.<br>

The first and last meal is a little heavier than the remaining two My eating habit was also very simple. I am starting with my last meal which was my dinner, I used to eat in between 10 am to 6 pm. And after that, I have a fast of 16 hours. I used to take a cup of warm lemon water in the morning. Then my first meal of the day begins at 10 am which was my breakfast. In this meal, I used to take my protein shake with some oats and almonds. This meal is complete, it consists of carbs, protein, and healthy fats in a good ratio. And it is important to have a high protein diet after a long fast.
      <br>
The second meal includes Rice, Lentils, 2 eggs(1 whole and 1 egg white), and a lot of vegetables. This is also a complete Indian diet which comprises of all the macronutrients in a good amount.<br>The third meal of the day, it consists of some fruits which I used to eat in variation. (Banana, Mangoes, Apple, etc). Fruits and veggies provide the fiber that helps fill you up and keep your digestive system good and it is low in calories.<br> The final meal was a little heavy, in this meal I used to do eat 1 or 2 roti with vegetables, 2 eggs(1 whole and 1 egg white), Along with it, I used to had a glass of milk.

      <h5>Benefits that I had experienced</h5>
<p>-> Weight Loss- intermittent fasting benefits me to eat fewer calories while boosting metabolism slightly.<br>
->  Better Focus on my work- My meals were planned so I was more focused on my studies. And it also helped me to be productive most of the time.<br>
->  Less or No eating of junk- There are only eight hours of feeding myself so I stuck to my diet and does not eat junk.<br>
->  Improved digestion- My digestive system gets enough time to digest the food and I feel no more bloated anymore.<br>
->  Less eating more drinking- Sometimes, I drink more water and detox drink whenever I feel hungry in these fasting hours. <br>
->  It taught a very good lesson about eating mindfully.
</p>
<h5>Additional advantages of Intermittent Fasting.</h5>
->  Insulin levels: Blood levels of insulin drop significantly, which promotes fat burning. And It can reduce insulin resistance and lower blood sugar levels, at least in men.<br>
->  Human growth hormone: The blood levels of growth hormone may increase Higher levels of this hormone facilitate fat burning and muscle gain,
->  Cellular repair: The body induces important cellular repair processes, such as removing waste material from cells.
<br>->  Studies show that intermittent fasting can reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in the body. It also lowers cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers.
<p>The above are evidence-based health benefits of intermittent fasting.</p>
<h5>Recommended eating tips.</h5>
<p>
  A balanced diet which consists of

Fruits and vegetables <br>->  Whole grains, including barley, brown rice, oats. <br>->  Protein sources, such as chicken, eggs fish, beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, low-fat paneer.   <br>->  healthful fats from fatty fish, olives, olive oil, coconuts, avocados, nuts, and seeds. <br>->  Most important drinking a lot of water in both periods (eating and fasting). <br>
<i>I hope my experience will add a little value to your learning to intermittent fasting.</i>
